Snippets for [GreyWywern's Virtual Keyboard Interface](http://www.greywyvern.com/code/javascript/keyboard).

Folder `1.49` contains the original files.

The file `keyboard_ru-ocs.js` has a Russian keyboard also containing Old Church Slavonic characters (on Ñ¢ / ALT).

In `keyboard_am_ti.js` keyboards for Amharic and Tigrinya have been added.

The optional file `keyboard-touch.js` prevents touch keyboards on mobile devices from opening, so the virtual keyboard will be used. `keyboard-touch.css` is the according stylesheet, making the keyboard mobile friendly
