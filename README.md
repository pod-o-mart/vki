Snippets for [GreyWywern's Virtual Keyboard Interface](http://www.greywyvern.com/code/javascript/keyboard).

`keyboard.js` is the original file.

The file `keyboard_ru-ocs.js` has a Russian keyboard also containing Old Church Slavonic characters (on Ñ¢ / ALT).

In `keyboard_am_ti.js` keyboards for Amharic and Tigrinya have been added.
