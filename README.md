Snippets for [GreyWywern's Virtual Keyboard Interface](http://www.greywyvern.com/code/javascript/keyboard).

Folder `1.49` contains the original files.

The updated version in the root folder has additionally keyboards for Amharic, Tigrinya, Glagolitic, Old Church Slavonic, Crimean Tatar and Turkmen.

The Bulgarian, Serbian, Chinese (Pinyin), Turkish Q, Ukrainian and Russian have been updated.

Russian has been extended with old characters and an own meta key (on Ñ¢ instead of AltGr).

The optional file `keyboard-touch.js` prevents touch keyboards on mobile devices from opening, so the virtual keyboard will be used. `keyboard-touch.css` is the according stylesheet, making the keyboard mobile friendly.
