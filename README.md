[GreyWywern's Virtual Keyboard Interface](http://www.greywyvern.com/code/javascript/keyboard) improved and extended 

## Improvements and updates
The new version in the root folder has additionally keyboards for Amharic, Tigrinya, Glagolitic, Old Church Slavonic, Crimean Tatar and Turkmen.

Bulgarian, Serbian, Chinese (Pinyin), Turkish Q, Ukrainian and Russian have been updated.

Russian has been extended with old characters and an own meta key (on Ñ¢ instead of AltGr).

Folder `1.49` contains the original files from [GreyWyvern](http://www.greywyvern.com/code/javascript/keyboard).

## Mobile usage
The optional file `keyboard-touch.js` prevents touch keyboards on mobile devices from opening, so the virtual keyboard will be used. `keyboard-touch.css` is the according stylesheet, making the keyboard mobile friendly.

In order to make the script work, add the declaration
`data-disable-touch-keyboard=""` to your input field or textarea, e.g. `<input data-disable-touch-keyboard="" id="example" name="example">`.
 You will also need [JQUERY](https://jquery.com/) and [modernizr.js](https://modernizr.com/).
 
 ## Bookmarklet
 There is a [ready-to-use bookmarklet](https://github.com/pod-o-mart/keyboardBookmarklets) available.
